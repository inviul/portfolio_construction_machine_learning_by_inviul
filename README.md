<h2>Portfolio Construction using Machine Leaning & Optimization theory</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
In recent decade, data science played one of the vital roles in revolutionizing the financial industry. This project leverages market historical data, company’s fundamental data, the recent trends, feature engineering and various pre-trained machine learning algorithms to construct and optimize the high return portfolios. This experiment is emphasizing on minimizing the risks so that ROI can be increased from portfolio. We are using concept of information retrieval to get company’s fundamental and price trend data from financial sites; After data gathering phase, in-depth exploratory data analysis performed to draw the facts from the dataset(s). Next, comes feature engineering with Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Further, MPT theory is applied to check the similar returns from the assets.
Clustering is used on pricing dataset to make two different portfolios; further these portfolios are merged with company’s fundamental data to get overall return. Various regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net, SGD and Artificial Neural Networks are used on merged dataset to study the comparative performance of the portfolios.
