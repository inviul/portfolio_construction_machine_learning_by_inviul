<h2>Portfolio Construction using Machine Leaning & Optimization theory</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
In recent decade, data science played one of the vital roles in revolutionizing the financial industry. This dissertation project will leverage market historical data, the recent trends, feature engineering and various pre-trained machine learning algorithms to construct and optimize the high return portfolios. The goal is to reduce the risks and increase the overall returns of the portfolios.
This goal will be achieved through various processes and technologies which first of all includes gathering all the historical and trends based financial data having information on stocks opening and closing prices, company’s fundamental’s analytical data, market indices and other economic factors. After data gathering phase, in-depth exploratory data analysis will be performed to draw the facts from the dataset(s). Next, comes feature engineering using various portfolio optimization concepts like Factor model analysis, Risk exposure data and Market position data. Along with these, covariance rule and MPT theory will be applied to check the similar returns of the asset.
EDA and feature engineering will give the informative data used for training the model. Therefore, machine learning algorithms like time series analysis, regression, clustering, and few deep learning techniques (which will be optional to this project) will be used to train the model to construct the well optimized portfolios for maximum return with less risk.
This project will leverage some of the real-world scenarios for investment decisions along with robust statistical analysis. The overall performance of the project will be evaluated on multiple parameters like Precision, Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion matrix, portfolio volatility, returns based on risk adjustment, etc. This is ensuring the all round outcome of the project from business as well as technical side.
The final outcome of the project will help many stakeholders to draw their investment decisions through machine learning and data science with in depth analysis of portfolios, risks, and economical factors.
At the end, a web UI will be created to display the portfolio.
